## Why should I use CSS?

No exercises for this tutorial.


## Creating and saving CSS files

First, create a CSS file in this folder called `main.css`.

Then create a second CSS file in this folder with a custom name.


## Linking an external CSS file

Add a `link` element to the `index.html` file and link the `main.css` file to it.

Check the `index.html` file in your browser to make sure the files are connected (the text should turn red).
